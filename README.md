# ArXiv Paper Downloader

This program helps researchers and students easily find and download academic papers from arXiv. Simply enter a search term, and the program will find relevant papers and automatically download them to your computer.

The program creates organized folders for each paper it downloads, making it easy to keep track of your research collection. Each paper gets its own timestamped folder with a descriptive name based on the paper's title.

When you run the program, it will ask you what topic you want to search for and how many papers you'd like to download. It then handles all the downloading and organization automatically, so you can focus on reading and research instead of managing files.
